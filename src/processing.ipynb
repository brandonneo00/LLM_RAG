Tackling Immediate Challenges\\n\\n13. Sir, we have enjoyed low inflation in Singapore for more than a decade. But inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, which led to significant increases in global energy and food prices.\\n\\n14. Despite the unprecedented surge in prices, we had good economic growth in 2022. So incomes that year rose faster than inflation and Singaporeans were better off, in real terms.\\n\\n15. Unfortunately, this did not happen last year. Inflation had in fact started to moderate. But economic growth also slowed. As a result, real incomes declined.\\n\\n16. We had picked up early indicators of this negative trend. And that is why I introduced the Cost-of-Living Support Package in September last year, and enhanced the Assurance Package to over $10 billion.\\n\\n17. While we expect the situation to improve this year, there are uncertainties in the outlook as I mentioned just now. So in this Budget, I will do more to support households and further enhance the Assurance Package.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Equipping Our Workers for Life\\n\\n54. Sir, people and talent are critical to our economic dynamism. We are investing heavily in our human capital, including in preschool and education. But learning cannot stop when formal schooling ends, and that is why we launched SkillsFuture – to systematically support Singaporeans in reskilling and upskilling, and to equip them throughout life.\\n\\n55. The Singapore workforce today ranks highly in terms of skills and technical proficiency. Our workers are able to command a premium in the global marketplace because of their expertise. But with rapid technological advances, expertise is in constant flux. Jobs like data entry clerks and door-to-door salesmen have dwindled in numbers. New jobs that did not exist decades ago, like data scientists and digital marketers are now in demand.\\n\\n56. Expertise keeps on changing. In other words, robots and machines will not completely replace humans at work. But they do change the way expertise is defined and how value is created.

Are we doing enough to help Singaporeans cope with inflation?\\n\\n5. First, on helping Singaporeans cope with inflation and cost pressures. Several Members, including Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Henry Kwek, Ms Hazel Poa and many others, spoke about this.\\n\\n6. Let us start by looking at the reasons for high inflation over the last two years. These reasons are certainly not unique to Singapore. For more than a decade before Covid, global inflation was generally stable, hovering at around 4% per annum. Singapore enjoyed relatively stable inflation too, and in most years, it was lower than global inflation.\\n\\n7. But in 2021, prices in global food, goods, and energy markets rose quickly, as strong demand came up against constrained supply due to pandemic-related restrictions.\\n\\n8. Then the Russia-Ukraine war broke out in early 2022. The two countries are major suppliers of key commodities, like oil and gas, fertiliser, and wheat. This brought about a further surge in prices. Many countries also saw a surge in demand for domestic services, and did not have sufficient workers to meet the demand.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

These are the key drivers of inflation everywhere. Singapore, like all other countries, felt the impact too.\\n\\n10. Even so, inflation in Singapore did not reach the peaks seen in several parts of the world.\\n\\n11. One reason was effective monetary policy. MAS tightened monetary policy five consecutive times starting in October 2021. This meant allowing the Singapore dollar to appreciate more quickly, which helped to shield us against the sharp spike in imported inflation. Had MAS not acted, core inflation for the whole of 2023 would have been 6.6%, instead of 4.2%.\\n\\n12. Other major central banks acted too.\\n\\n13. With the overall monetary tightening and the stabilisation of supply chains, significant headway has been made in bringing inflation down around the world.\\n\\n14.

Several Members, including Ms Ng Ling Ling, Mr Ong Hua Han, and Mr Faisal Manap, also highlighted other specific cost items – namely in housing and transport. So, let’s drill deeper into this data.\\n\\n16. Take public housing. Over the last 10 years, the average price of a 4-room BTO flat in non-mature estates has remained relatively stable, even as median household incomes increased. So, in real terms, the affordability of such BTO flats has, in fact, improved.

The Government is already providing generous subsidies to keep our public transport system going. Fares have increased, but household incomes have risen faster. That is why the proportion of household income spent on public transport has fallen over the last 10 years.\\n\\n18. We also track real wages closely. As Members are aware, real wage growth was negative last year. But we know that many employers are complaining of shortage of workers and higher wage costs, especially in services. So, it is not negative across the board.

We are able to command better prices in world markets, and this in turn benefits our workers, who are able to enjoy higher wages.\\n\\n41. This is how we are able to stay competitive, despite our higher costs. One way to see this is to look at Singapore’s share of global exports. Since 2010, even while our cost base has gone up, our share of the world’s total goods exports has been maintained at about 2%. Our share of global services exports has increased from 2.5% to 4.1%. We are able to hold our own, maintain our competitiveness and add value to make a living for ourselves and for our workers.\\n\\n42.

To be clear, this is a very ambitious goal. Only a few countries, at our stage of development, have been able to sustain such high productivity growth. It requires a continual transformation of our economy. Firms need to learn new ways to do business, workers need to learn new skills to contribute differently, and to embrace new technologies. New firms in new sectors must start up and grow, and more than replace the firms in declining industries. As Ms Mariam Jaafar and several Members have noted, this is a massive undertaking – but we are aiming high and we are determined to do our best to achieve this.\\n\\n45.

We recognise that in this new environment, there will be more stresses and strains on our people. With more rapid technological advances and more intense competition, we can expect more churn at workplaces. Some jobs will become obsolete, while new jobs with better pay will be created. All this will be very unsettling for those who are affected.\\n\\n90.

The CIT Rebate, less any CIT Rebate Cash Grant received, will be automatically incorporated in the companies’ tax assessments raised after they file their CIT returns for YA 2024.\\n\\nFor example, Company A hired two local employees in 2023. It has a CIT assessment of $30,000 for YA 2024. Company A will receive a $2,000 CIT Rebate Cash Grant by 3Q 2024.

There will be three enhancements to the EFS under the Enterprise Support Package.\\n\\nFirst, the maximum loan quantum under the EFS – SME Working Capital Loan will be permanently enhanced from $300,000 to $500,000. This will help SMEs to meet their increased working capital and operational cashflow needs, especially amid elevated costs.\\n\\nSecond, the enhanced maximum loan quantum under the EFS – Trade Loan of $10 million will be extended till 31 March 2025.

It will be awarded on an approval basis, through EDB and EnterpriseSG.\\n\\nThe RIC will support high‑value and substantive economic activities such as:\\n\\n- (i) Investing in new productive capacity (e.g., new manufacturing plant, production of low‑carbon energy);\\n- (ii) Expanding or establishing the scope of activities in digital services, professional services, and supply chain management;\\n- (iii) Expanding or establishing headquarter activities, or Centres of Excellence;\\n- (iv) Setting up or expansion of activities by commodity trading firms;\\n- (v) Carrying out R&D and innovation activities; and\\n- (vi) Implementing solutions with decarbonisation objectives.\\n\\n# How the RIC works\\n\\nThe RIC is awarded on qualifying expenditures incurred by the company in respect of a qualifying project, during the qualifying period. Each RIC award will have a qualifying period of up to 10 years.\\n\\nThe credits are to be offset against Corporate Income Tax payable. Any unutilised credits will be refunded to the company in cash within four years from when the company satisfies the conditions for receiving the credits.

SkillsFuture Mid‑Career Training Allowance.\\n\\n# (A) $4,000 SkillsFuture Credit (“SFC”) (Mid-Career) Top-Up\\n\\nThe SFC was introduced at Budget 2015 to encourage Singaporeans to take ownership of their skills development. To provide more support for mid‑career Singaporeans, we will provide a $4,000 SFC (Mid‑Career) top‑up to every Singaporean in the year they turn 40 years old. Singaporeans currently aged 40 and above will receive the top‑up in May 2024. The credit will have no expiry date.\\n\\nEligible individuals can use the SFC top‑up for selected courses that are industry‑oriented and have better employability outcomes. More details on eligible courses will be announced at the MOE Committee of Supply.\\n\\n# (B) Support for Singaporeans to pursue another subsidised Full-Time Diploma\\n\\nCurrently, individuals who have previously received MOE subsidies or Government sponsorship for a diploma or higher qualification (e.g., degree) are not eligible for another subsidised full‑time diploma qualification at our institutions.\\n\\nFrom Academic Year 2025, Singaporeans aged 40 and above will qualify for the Mid‑Career Enhanced Subsidy for another subsidised full‑time diploma at our Polytechnics, ITE, and Arts Institutions (i.e., Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and LASALLE College of the Arts). This will expand the opportunities available for mid‑career Singaporeans to take subsidised courses.\\n\\n# (C) SkillsFuture Mid-Career Training Allowance\\n\\nTo better support mid‑career workers who need to undergo substantive reskilling, we will provide a training allowance to Singaporeans aged 40 and above who undertake full‑time long‑form training, to partially offset the income loss from taking time off from work. This will be made available from early 2025, for eligible individuals who enrol in the following full‑time long‑form training programmes:\\n\\n1. Full‑time SkillsFuture Career Transition Programme courses, which are designed to support mid‑career transitions into sectors with good hiring opportunities; and\\n2.

The Government will make the following adjustments:\\n\\n1. Enhance the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme;\\n2. Raise the Local Qualifying Salary; and\\n3. Enhance the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme.\\n\\n# (A) Enhancements to the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme (“Workfare”)\\n\\nWorkfare supplements the incomes and CPF savings of lower‑wage Singaporean workers, and encourages them to work regularly. Employees do not need to apply for Workfare, as eligibility is automatically assessed based on CPF contributions. Self‑employed persons will have to declare their income, and make the required MediSave contributions to receive Workfare payments.\\n\\nEnhancements to Workfare will apply to work done from 1 January 2025. The enhanced Workfare will benefit around half a million Singaporeans.\\n\\n# Enhancements to Workfare\\n\\n1. Qualifying monthly wage cap will be raised from $2,500 to $3,000.1 This takes into account wage growth of Singaporeans. The higher qualifying monthly wage cap of $3,000 will also apply to the Workfare Skills Support scheme.\\n2. Higher Workfare payments of up to $4,900 per year. Payments, which depend on age and wages, will be enhanced across all age bands. Eligible employees will receive up to $4,900 per year, compared to $4,200 per year today (see Table 1). Older workers and all persons with disabilities will continue to receive the highest payments. The payments for self‑employed persons are set at two‑thirds of the payments for employees, and will be correspondingly increased.\\n\\n# Table 1: Maximum Annual Workfare Payments for Employees\\n\\n|Age Band|Before Enhancement (For Work Done from 1 Jan 2023 to 31 Dec 2024)|After Enhancement (For Work Done from 1 Jan 2025)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|30-34|$2,100|$2,450|\\n|35-44|$3,000|$3,500|\\n|45-59|$3,600|$4,200|\\n|60 & above|$4,200|$4,900|\\n|All persons with disabilities|$4,200|$4,900|\\n\\n1 In addition, the worker must earn an average gross monthly wage of not more than $3,000 in the past 12 months.', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

The number of local workers paid the LQS is used to determine the firm’s foreign worker quota entitlement.\\n\\nThe LQS is regularly reviewed to keep pace with wage growth, to continue to uplift lower‑wage workers and maintain foreign workforce controls.\\n\\nThe Government will raise the LQS from $1,400 to $1,600 per month. Firms hiring foreign workers will have to pay all their local workers at least the LQS (or Progressive Wage Model wages where applicable):\\n\\n- (i) At least $1,600 per month for full‑time local workers; or\\n- (ii) At least $10.50 per hour for part‑time local workers.\\n\\nForeign worker quota computation will correspondingly be adjusted with the new LQS:\\n\\n- (i) 1 local workforce count: Per local worker who is paid at least $1,600 per month;\\n- (ii) 0.5 local workforce count: Per local worker who is paid at least $800 but less than $1,600 per month.\\n\\nThese changes will be implemented from 1 July 2024.\\n\\n# (C) Enhancements to the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (“PWCS”)\\n\\nThe PWCS was introduced at Budget 2022 to provide transitional support from 2022 to 2026 to help employers adjust to the Progressive Wages moves, as well as encourage employers to voluntarily raise the wages of their lower‑wage employees.\\n\\nThe PWCS co‑funds the wage increases that employers give to resident lower‑wage employees with gross monthly wages of up to $3,000. The average gross monthly wage increase must be at least $100 in each qualifying year. Wage increases given in each qualifying year will be co‑funded for two years, if the wage increase is sustained. This is to help employers manage the compounding effect of wage increases year on year.\\n\\n# Increase in PWCS Co‑Funding Support for 2024\\n\\nTo strengthen support for employers in uplifting lower‑wage employees, the PWCS co‑funding support will be enhanced for wage increases given in qualifying year 2024 (see Table 2). The enhanced co‑funding support will also apply to wage increases given in qualifying year 2023 that are sustained in 2024.\\n\\n# Increase in Wage Ceiling for PWCS Co‑Funding from 2025 Onwards\\n\\nThe gross monthly wage ceiling for PWCS co‑funding will be increased from $2,500 to $3,000 in qualifying years 2025 and 2026 (see Table 2).\\n\\nMINISTRY OF FINANCE', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Both SA and RA savings earn the same long-term interest rate. However, some SA savings can be withdrawn on demand from age 55. As a principle, only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the long-term interest rate, and savings that can be withdrawn on demand should earn the short-term interest rate.\\n\\nTo better align CPF interest rates to the nature of CPF savings in each CPF account, the Government will close the SA for members aged 55 and above from early 2025. SA savings will be transferred to the RA, up to the Full Retirement Sum. These savings will continue to earn the long-term interest rate. Any remaining SA savings will be transferred to the Ordinary Account (“OA”), where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate. Members can choose to transfer their OA savings to their RA at any time, up to the Enhanced Retirement Sum. Once transferred to the RA, the monies will be committed towards higher retirement payouts and will earn higher interest.\\n\\nWith the closure of the SA for members aged 55 and above, all members will have three CPF accounts at any one time:\\n\\n- For members below age 55, they will continue to have OA, SA, and MediSave Account (“MA”).\\n- For members aged 55 and above, they will only have OA, RA, MA.\\n\\n# (D) Enhancements to the Silver Support Scheme (“SSS”)\\n\\nThe SSS supports Singaporeans aged 65 and above who had low incomes during their working years, and have less family support.\\n\\nThe SSS will be enhanced to strengthen support for these seniors.

Qualifying overseas cash donations must meet the following two conditions to be eligible for tax deductions:\\n\\n1. Donation must be made through a designated charity. Designated charities should have emergency humanitarian assistance as part of their charitable objectives1, as well as enhanced governance and controls against illicit fund flows. Charities that qualify will be invited to participate in the pilot. The list of designated charities will be made available from 1 January 2025.\\n2. Donation must be made towards a fund‑raiser for emergency humanitarian assistance with a valid Fund‑Raising for Foreign Charitable Purposes (“FRFCP”) permit from the Commissioner of Charities (“COC”). Designated charities are required to apply for a FRFCP permit from the COC prior to commencement of a fund‑raising appeal for an emergency humanitarian assistance cause.\\n\\nThe COC will determine upon reviewing the FRFCP permit application whether a fund‑raiser in question is for an emergency humanitarian assistance cause. Emergency humanitarian assistance refers to emergency assistance tied to a specific incident with a clear trigger such as in response to natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes or floods) or other sudden crises (e.g., pandemics). Assistance typically includes rapid delivery of essentials such as food, clean water, shelter, medical care, and search, rescue, and evacuation efforts.\\n\\nTax deductions under OHAS will be capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income. For donors who also receive tax deductions under the Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme for Family Offices2 (“PTIS”), tax deductions under both OHAS and PTIS will be jointly capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income.\\n\\nAny unutilised tax deductions under the OHAS cannot be carried forward to offset the donor’s income for any subsequent Year of Assessment (“YA”) and cannot be transferred to another company of the same group under the Group Relief System for any YA.\\n\\n1 Notwithstanding these charities’ ability to carry out emergency humanitarian assistance overseas, these charities must still substantially benefit the community in Singapore.\\n\\n2 The PTIS provides qualifying donors 100% tax deduction for overseas cash donations made through qualifying local intermediaries, capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income. To qualify, donors must have a fund under Section 13O or 13U of the Income Tax Act 1947 and meet eligibility conditions, such as incremental local business spending of S$200,000.

Our own economy grew by a modest 1.1%, avoiding a recession.\\n\\n3. I know that many households are feeling the pressure of higher living costs.\\n\\n- a.

These conflicts can escalate dangerously, leading to disruptions in global energy markets and supply chains.\\n\\n# 5. Fortunately, there are some upsides.\\n\\na.

Tackling Immediate Challenges\\n\\n13. Sir, we have enjoyed low inflation in Singapore for more than a decade. But inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, which led to significant increases in global energy and food prices.\\n\\n14. Despite the unprecedented surge in prices, we had good economic growth in 2022. So incomes that year rose faster than inflation and Singaporeans were better off, in real terms.\\n\\n15. Unfortunately, this did not happen last year. Inflation had in fact started to moderate. But economic growth also slowed. As a result, real incomes declined.\\n\\n16. We had picked up early indicators of this negative trend. And that is why I introduced the Cost-of-Living Support Package in September last year, and enhanced the Assurance Package to over $10 billion.\\n\\n17. While we expect the situation to improve this year, there are uncertainties in the outlook as I mentioned just now. So in this Budget, I will do more to support households and further enhance the Assurance Package.'),\n",

But if we were to experience similarly slow growth for several years in a row, we will be in trouble. We will have no chance of improving our collective well-being.

The Singapore workforce today ranks highly in terms of skills and technical proficiency. Our workers are able to command a premium in the global marketplace because of their expertise. But with rapid technological advances, expertise is in constant flux. Jobs like data entry clerks and door-to-door salesmen have dwindled in numbers. New jobs that did not exist decades ago, like data scientists and digital marketers are now in demand.\\n\\n56. Expertise keeps on changing. In other words, robots and machines will not completely replace humans at work. But they do change the way expertise is defined and how value is created. We therefore have to invest even more in our human capital, and help our workers refresh and update their skills, and learn how to harness new technologies more effectively. Indeed, this is something that'),\n",

Prior to that Budget announcement, market rents had been relatively flat for the preceding five years. But from 2022 onwards, market rents increased significantly due to the combination of strong demand and Covid-related supply constraints. As a result, the Annual Values (or the AVs) also increased sharply. We had originally expected the Property Tax changes to impact mainly the top 7% of owner-occupied residential properties. But the AV increases resulted in the proportion of affected owner-occupied properties nearly doubling to 13%.\\n\\n152.

The second component is the Domestic Top-up Tax (or the DTT). This applies to the Singapore profits of MNE groups operating here. Without this tax, these MNE groups would have had to pay their parent jurisdictions the effective tax rate of 15% on their Singapore profits. Therefore, it is in our interest to implement the DTT, so that we collect the tax, rather than have it go somewhere else.\\n\\nd.

As part of Forward Singapore, we are making significant policy shifts to strengthen our social safety nets, and provide more assurance to Singaporeans.

In our projections, MOF had assessed that Government spending will increase to around 20% of GDP by 2030. For now, that remains our assessment. Assuming we stay within this range of spending increase, we should have sufficient revenues to maintain a balanced budget over the coming years.\\n\\n166. But the medium-term fiscal position is tight. Because there are so many pressures for us to spend more, be it on healthcare, social needs, or the energy transition, and these are all big-ticket items.

Are we doing enough to help Singaporeans cope with inflation?\\n\\n5. First, on helping Singaporeans cope with inflation and cost pressures. Several Members, including Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Henry Kwek, Ms Hazel Poa and many others, spoke about this.\\n\\n6. Let us start by looking at the reasons for high inflation over the last two years. These reasons are certainly not unique to Singapore. For more than a decade before Covid, global inflation was generally stable, hovering at around 4% per annum. Singapore enjoyed relatively stable inflation too, and in most years, it was lower than global inflation.\\n\\n7. But in 2021, prices in global food, goods, and energy markets rose quickly, as strong demand came up against constrained supply due to pandemic-related restrictions.\\n\\n8. Then the Russia-Ukraine war broke out in early 2022. The two countries are major suppliers of key commodities, like oil and gas, fertiliser, and wheat. This brought about a further surge in prices. Many countries also saw a surge in demand for domestic services, and did not have sufficient workers to meet the demand.'),\n",

These are the key drivers of inflation everywhere. Singapore, like all other countries, felt the impact too.\\n\\n10. Even so, inflation in Singapore did not reach the peaks seen in several parts of the world.\\n\\n11. One reason was effective monetary policy. MAS tightened monetary policy five consecutive times starting in October 2021. This meant allowing the Singapore dollar to appreciate more quickly, which helped to shield us against the sharp spike in imported inflation. Had MAS not acted, core inflation for the whole of 2023 would have been 6.6%, instead of 4.2%.\\n\\n12. Other major central banks acted too.\\n\\n13. With the overall monetary tightening and the stabilisation of supply chains, significant headway has been made in bringing inflation down around the world.\\n\\n14. Overall inflation has come down, in line with the rest of the world. In Singapore, our headline inflation was already moderating since last'),\n",

Several Members, including Ms Ng Ling Ling, Mr Ong Hua Han, and Mr Faisal Manap, also highlighted other specific cost items – namely in housing and transport. So, let’s drill deeper into this data.\\n\\n16. Take public housing. Over the last 10 years, the average price of a 4-room BTO flat in non-mature estates has remained relatively stable, even as median household incomes increased. So, in real terms, the affordability of such BTO flats has, in fact, improved. The challenge we faced was with the prices of BTO flats in choicer locations, which are'),\n",

That is why we introduced the new Standard, Plus, and Prime framework. With this framework, we can keep the BTO flats in these better locations affordable through more upfront subsidies. But it will be a fair system, because the additional subsidies will be clawed back when the first owners sell the flats.\\n\\n17. Or take public transport. The Government is already providing generous subsidies to keep our public transport system going. Fares have increased, but household incomes have risen faster. That is why the proportion of household income spent on public transport has fallen over the last 10 years.\\n\\n18. We also track real wages closely. As Members are aware, real wage growth was negative last year. But we know that many employers are complaining of shortage of workers and higher wage costs, especially in services. So, it is not negative across the board. Some workers are still getting real wage increases, and at the household level, there was real median income growth, on a per household member basis.'),\n",

In countries everywhere, including in Singapore, there tends to be a gap between economic data and perceptions. It is partly because it takes time for consumers to adjust to new economic realities.\\n\\n21. Perceptions and sentiments are clearly important, and we take the feedback from the ground seriously, but we also need to examine the data closely to better shape policy responses.\\n\\n22. It is in this broader context that the Government had extended support packages over the last two years to cushion the impact of inflation, particularly for lower- and middle-income Singaporeans.\\n\\n23. This year, while inflation is moderating, we recognise that prices are still relatively high, and there are continued pressures for families and individuals.

For middle-income households, it will substantially cover the increase in spending due to inflation this year.\\n\\n27. We are not only helping families. We are also helping businesses cope with higher costs, especially SMEs.\\n\\n28. One of the reasons for rising business costs is higher wages for Singaporeans.

We are doing more to help businesses in this Budget through the Enterprise Support Package – this is the most generous Corporate Income Tax rebate we have extended to date.

Sir, there are many other examples like this. MNEs have continued to grow and upgrade their presence here in Singapore because they value our skilled workforce, our infrastructure, and our connectivity to help them better access key markets in the region and beyond. So, when you add it all up, it means that the value-added content of our manufacturing sector has increased. We are able to command better prices in world markets, and this in turn benefits our workers, who are able to enjoy higher wages.\\n\\n41. This is how we are able to stay competitive, despite our higher costs. One way to see this is to look at Singapore’s share of global exports. Since 2010, even while our cost base has gone up, our share of the world’s total goods exports has been maintained at about 2%. Our share of global services exports has increased from 2.5% to 4.1%. We are able to hold our own, maintain our competitiveness and add value to make a living for ourselves and for our workers.\\n\\n42. The question is how do we continue to maintain or even increase our share of global exports in the years to come? The only way is through productivity improvements, something which Deputy Prime Minister Heng emphasised yesterday.'),\n",

We aim for 2~3% economic growth per annum over the next decade on average. Of this, about 1~2 percentage points should be from productivity improvements.\\n\\n44. To be clear, this is a very ambitious goal. Only a few countries, at our stage of development, have been able to sustain such high productivity growth. It requires a continual transformation of our economy. Firms need to learn new ways to do business, workers need to learn new skills to contribute differently, and to embrace new technologies. New firms in new sectors must start up and grow, and more than replace the firms in declining industries. As Ms Mariam Jaafar and several Members have noted, this is a massive undertaking – but we are aiming high and we are determined to do our best to achieve this.\\n\\n45. One key strategy is to attract more high-quality investments into Singapore. Because these investments typically involve cutting-edge and innovative activities. They help to push the productivity frontier and that is why we need new investment promotion tools like the Refundable Investment Credit.'),\n",

Some have voiced concerns about whether we will become a two-track economy – one track for MNEs and another track for SMEs. I can understand these concerns, but it is not so helpful to think of the economy in terms of larger foreign and smaller local companies.\\n\\n48. A better way is to consider the two broad segments of the economy – one that is outward-oriented and another that is domestic-oriented. Every economy, including in Singapore, has these two segments. And each faces different challenges and business conditions.\\n\\n49. The outward-oriented segment of the economy comprises MNEs, but it also has many local enterprises, big and small. Together, they make up about 60% of the firms in Singapore. And there are many supplier and partnership arrangements between MNEs and local firms. We want to encourage more of these partnerships, and we have enhanced the PACT scheme in this Budget to do so.'),\n",

With more rapid technological advances and more intense competition, we can expect more churn at workplaces. Some jobs will become obsolete, while new jobs with better pay will be created.

But Pillar One has been delayed, and if it is implemented, it will clearly be revenue-negative for Singapore.\\n\\n150. After taking into account all this, what is our fiscal position?\\n\\n151. Last year, MOF published an Occasional Paper on our medium-term fiscal outlook, up to FY2030. We showed that our spending needs would grow as a percentage of the G P, to support our ageing population and expand and strengthen our social safety nets, and there would be a funding gap of more than 1% of G P if we did nothing. But with the tax measures announced in the last two Budgets, including the GST rate increase, we project that we could close the funding gap, provided we manage the pace of spending growth. All that was in the Occasional Paper, and that is indeed what we have done.\\n\\n152. Tax changes have come into effect, although we have not yet experienced the full revenue impact, because we have given some rebates. We also enjoyed some revenue upsides. Some are due to sentiment-driven revenues like Stamp duty and Vehicle Quota.'),\n",

This is no different from how one would manage one’s own personal finances. Imagine if you are a home-owner planning for a major renovation in five years’ time. What do you do? You start setting aside resources for this now, for the major expenditure in future. You do not wait until renovation starts before you look for the money, and hope that it is there somehow.\\n\\n155. In the same way, we have set up Funds to meet real commitments, and real spending needs. Some of it are for recurring commitments, such as the permanent GST Voucher scheme, which we draw on year after year; for new commitments like the Majulah Package; and for major spending needs that are coming up, like the Future Energy Fund, which will help to decarbonise our energy system.\\n\\nPage 49 of 56'),\n",

If this Government makes a commitment, we make sure it is properly funded. We make sure we deliver on our promises.\\n\\n157. But let us also be clear. The days of structural fiscal surpluses in Singapore are over. If you look at our economic and fiscal situation, growth will come down. We hope to achieve 2-3%.

Tackling Immediate Challenges\\n\\n13. Sir, we have enjoyed low inflation in Singapore for more than a decade. But inflation rose sharply in 2022, following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, which led to significant increases in global energy and food prices.\\n\\n14. Despite the unprecedented surge in prices, we had good economic growth in 2022. So incomes that year rose faster than inflation and Singaporeans were better off, in real terms.\\n\\n15. Unfortunately, this did not happen last year. Inflation had in fact started to moderate. But economic growth also slowed. As a result, real incomes declined.\\n\\n16. We had picked up early indicators of this negative trend. And that is why I introduced the Cost-of-Living Support Package in September last year, and enhanced the Assurance Package to over $10 billion.\\n\\n17.

First, companies will receive a 50% Corporate Income Tax Rebate, capped at $40,000, in the Year of Assessment 2024. Not all companies are profitable, and some may not benefit from such a rebate.

But if we were to experience similarly slow growth for several years in a row, we will be in trouble. We will have no chance of improving our collective well-being. Singaporeans’ living standards will be dented. We will not be able to afford the social services we need. And in the end, lower-income workers and families will be hit the hardest.\\n\\n27.

Are we doing enough to help Singaporeans cope with inflation?\\n\\n5. First, on helping Singaporeans cope with inflation and cost pressures. Several Members, including Mr Yip Hon Weng, Mr Gan Thiam Poh, Mr Henry Kwek, Ms Hazel Poa and many others, spoke about this.\\n\\n6. Let us start by looking at the reasons for high inflation over the last two years. These reasons are certainly not unique to Singapore. For more than a decade before Covid, global inflation was generally stable, hovering at around 4% per annum. Singapore enjoyed relatively stable inflation too, and in most years, it was lower than global inflation.\\n\\n7. But in 2021, prices in global food, goods, and energy markets rose quickly, as strong demand came up against constrained supply due to pandemic-related restrictions.\\n\\n8. Then the Russia-Ukraine war broke out in early 2022. The two countries are major suppliers of key commodities, like oil and gas, fertiliser, and wheat. This brought about a further surge in prices. Many countries also saw a surge in demand for domestic services, and did not have sufficient workers to meet the demand.'),\n",

These are the key drivers of inflation everywhere. Singapore, like all other countries, felt the impact too.\\n\\n10. Even so, inflation in Singapore did not reach the peaks seen in several parts of the world.\\n\\n11. One reason was effective monetary policy. MAS tightened monetary policy five consecutive times starting in October 2021. This meant allowing the Singapore dollar to appreciate more quickly, which helped to shield us against the sharp spike in imported inflation. Had MAS not acted, core inflation for the whole of 2023 would have been 6.6%, instead of 4.2%.\\n\\n12. Other major central banks acted too.\\n\\n13. With the overall monetary tightening and the stabilisation of supply chains, significant headway has been made in bringing inflation down around the world.\\n\\n14. Overall inflation has come down, in line with the rest of the world. In Singapore, our headline inflation was already moderating since last'),\n",

Several Members, including Ms Ng Ling Ling, Mr Ong Hua Han, and Mr Faisal Manap, also highlighted other specific cost items – namely in housing and transport. So, let’s drill deeper into this data.\\n\\n16. Take public housing. Over the last 10 years, the average price of a 4-room BTO flat in non-mature estates has remained relatively stable, even as median household incomes increased. So, in real terms, the affordability of such BTO flats has, in fact, improved. The challenge we faced was with the prices of BTO flats in choicer locations, which are'),\n",

That is why we introduced the new Standard, Plus, and Prime framework. With this framework, we can keep the BTO flats in these better locations affordable through more upfront subsidies.

The Government is already providing generous subsidies to keep our public transport system going. Fares have increased, but household incomes have risen faster. That is why the proportion of household income spent on public transport has fallen over the last 10 years.\\n\\n18. We also track real wages closely. As Members are aware, real wage growth was negative last year. But we know that many employers are complaining of shortage of workers and higher wage costs, especially in services. So, it is not negative across the board. Some workers are still getting real wage increases, and at the household level, there was real median income growth, on a per household member basis.'),\n",

In countries everywhere, including in Singapore, there tends to be a gap between economic data and perceptions.

Perceptions and sentiments are clearly important, and we take the feedback from the ground seriously, but we also need to examine the data closely to better shape policy responses.\\n\\n22. It is in this broader context that the Government had extended support packages over the last two years to cushion the impact of inflation, particularly for lower- and middle-income Singaporeans.\\n\\n23. This year, while inflation is moderating, we recognise that prices are still relatively high, and there are continued pressures for families and individuals.

So, the support is targeted and tilted towards those with less.\\n\\n26. What will we achieve through the enhancements to the Assurance Package in this Budget? For lower-income households, it will fully cover their increase in spending due to inflation this year. For middle-income households, it will substantially cover the increase in spending due to inflation this year.\\n\\n27. We are not only helping families. We are also helping businesses cope with higher costs, especially SMEs.\\n\\n28. One of the reasons for rising business costs is higher wages for Singaporeans.

Sir, there are many other examples like this. MNEs have continued to grow and upgrade their presence here in Singapore because they value our skilled workforce, our infrastructure, and our connectivity to help them better access key markets in the region and beyond. So, when you add it all up, it means that the value-added content of our manufacturing sector has increased. We are able to command better prices in world markets, and this in turn benefits our workers, who are able to enjoy higher wages.\\n\\n41. This is how we are able to stay competitive, despite our higher costs. One way to see this is to look at Singapore’s share of global exports. Since 2010, even while our cost base has gone up, our share of the world’s total goods exports has been maintained at about 2%. Our share of global services exports has increased from 2.5% to 4.1%. We are able to hold our own, maintain our competitiveness and add value to make a living for ourselves and for our workers.\\n\\n42. The question is how do we continue to maintain or even increase our share of global exports in the years to come? The only way is through productivity improvements, something which Deputy Prime Minister Heng emphasised yesterday.'),\n",

We aim for 2~3% economic growth per annum over the next decade on average. Of this, about 1~2 percentage points should be from productivity improvements.\\n\\n44. To be clear, this is a very ambitious goal. Only a few countries, at our stage of development, have been able to sustain such high productivity growth. It requires a continual transformation of our economy. Firms need to learn new ways to do business, workers need to learn new skills to contribute differently, and to embrace new technologies. New firms in new sectors must start up and grow, and more than replace the firms in declining industries. As Ms Mariam Jaafar and several Members have noted, this is a massive undertaking – but we are aiming high and we are determined to do our best to achieve this.\\n\\n45. One key strategy is to attract more high-quality investments into Singapore. Because these investments typically involve cutting-edge and innovative activities. They help to push the productivity frontier and that is why we need new investment promotion tools like the Refundable Investment Credit.'),\n",

I can understand these concerns, but it is not so helpful to think of the economy in terms of larger foreign and smaller local companies.\\n\\n48. A better way is to consider the two broad segments of the economy – one that is outward-oriented and another that is domestic-oriented. Every economy, including in Singapore, has these two segments. And each faces different challenges and business conditions.\\n\\n49. The outward-oriented segment of the economy comprises MNEs, but it also has many local enterprises, big and small. Together, they make up about 60% of the firms in Singapore. And there are many supplier and partnership arrangements between MNEs and local firms.

Last year, MOF published an Occasional Paper on our medium-term fiscal outlook, up to FY2030. We showed that our spending needs would grow as a percentage of the G P, to support our ageing population and expand and strengthen our social safety nets, and there would be a funding gap of more than 1% of G P if we did nothing. But with the tax measures announced in the last two Budgets, including the GST rate increase, we project that we could close the funding gap, provided we manage the pace of spending growth. All that was in the Occasional Paper, and that is indeed what we have done.\\n\\n152.

We want to refresh our social compact to keep our society strong and united in this troubled world. We want to build a better Singapore – not just for a few, but for all Singaporeans. We want to refresh the Singapore dream, and build a Singapore that is vibrant and inclusive, fair and thriving, resilient and united.\\n\\n171. The road ahead to this better Singapore will not be easy. But we are all in this together, and we all have a part to play. The Government will do more to provide opportunities and assurances at every stage of life, and everyone in society should contribute towards our shared goals and aspirations in our own ways.\\n\\nPage 55 of 56'),\n",

Enhance the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme.\\n\\n# (A) Enhancements to the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme (“Workfare”)\\n\\nWorkfare supplements the incomes and CPF savings of lower‑wage Singaporean workers, and encourages them to work regularly. Employees do not need to apply for Workfare, as eligibility is automatically assessed based on CPF contributions. Self‑employed persons will have to declare their income, and make the required MediSave contributions to receive Workfare payments.\\n\\nEnhancements to Workfare will apply to work done from 1 January 2025. The enhanced Workfare will benefit around half a million Singaporeans.\\n\\n# Enhancements to Workfare\\n\\n1. Qualifying monthly wage cap will be raised from $2,500 to $3,000.1 This takes into account wage growth of Singaporeans. The higher qualifying monthly wage cap of $3,000 will also apply to the Workfare Skills Support scheme.\\n2. Higher Workfare payments of up to $4,900 per year. Payments, which depend on age and wages, will be enhanced across all age bands. Eligible employees will receive up to $4,900 per year, compared to $4,200 per year today (see Table 1). Older workers and all persons with disabilities will continue to receive the highest payments.

The average gross monthly wage increase must be at least $100 in each qualifying year. Wage increases given in each qualifying year will be co‑funded for two years, if the wage increase is sustained. This is to help employers manage the compounding effect of wage increases year on year.\\n\\n# Increase in PWCS Co‑Funding Support for 2024\\n\\nTo strengthen support for employers in uplifting lower‑wage employees, the PWCS co‑funding support will be enhanced for wage increases given in qualifying year 2024 (see Table 2).

Any remaining SA savings will be transferred to the Ordinary Account (“OA”), where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate. Members can choose to transfer their OA savings to their RA at any time, up to the Enhanced Retirement Sum.

Qualifying overseas cash donations must meet the following two conditions to be eligible for tax deductions:\\n\\n1. Donation must be made through a designated charity. Designated charities should have emergency humanitarian assistance as part of their charitable objectives1, as well as enhanced governance and controls against illicit fund flows. Charities that qualify will be invited to participate in the pilot. The list of designated charities will be made available from 1 January 2025.\\n2. Donation must be made towards a fund‑raiser for emergency humanitarian assistance with a valid Fund‑Raising for Foreign Charitable Purposes (“FRFCP”) permit from the Commissioner of Charities (“COC”). Designated charities are required to apply for a FRFCP permit from the COC prior to commencement of a fund‑raising appeal for an emergency humanitarian assistance cause.\\n\\nThe COC will determine upon reviewing the FRFCP permit application whether a fund‑raiser in question is for an emergency humanitarian assistance cause. Emergency humanitarian assistance refers to emergency assistance tied to a specific incident with a clear trigger such as in response to natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes or floods) or other sudden crises (e.g., pandemics). Assistance typically includes rapid delivery of essentials such as food, clean water, shelter, medical care, and search, rescue, and evacuation efforts.\\n\\nTax deductions under OHAS will be capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income. For donors who also receive tax deductions under the Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme for Family Offices2 (“PTIS”), tax deductions under both OHAS and PTIS will be jointly capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income.\\n\\nAny unutilised tax deductions under the OHAS cannot be carried forward to offset the donor’s income for any subsequent Year of Assessment (“YA”) and cannot be transferred to another company of the same group under the Group Relief System for any YA.\\n\\n1 Notwithstanding these charities’ ability to carry out emergency humanitarian assistance overseas, these charities must still substantially benefit the community in Singapore.\\n\\n2 The PTIS provides qualifying donors 100% tax deduction for overseas cash donations made through qualifying local intermediaries, capped at 40% of the donor’s statutory income. To qualify, donors must have a fund under Section 13O or 13U of the Income Tax Act 1947 and meet eligibility conditions, such as incremental local business spending of S$200,000.
